# This folder is to document my understanding of RL

# Deepmind video series :

## Paradigm specs: essentially trial and error
- No supervisor; only a reward signal
- Feedback might be delayed; not instantaneous
- Time matters (sequential, non iid data)
- Agent influences said data

## The RL optimisation problem
- Reward R_t is a scalar feedback signal. Indicates how well agent is doing at step t. We want to maximise it. "Reward hypothesis: all goals can be described by the maximisation of expected cumulative reward"
- Goal: select actions to maximise total future reward. Actions may have long term consequences, rewards might be delayed; it might be better to sacrifice immediate reward to gain more later...
- Obs -> agent -> action
     reward^
